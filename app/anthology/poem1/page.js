Wise beyond years <br />
With a presence beyond stature <br />
Through laughter and tears <br />
Words could not capture <br />
<br />
Nothing else compares <br />
From before or from after <br />
To the elegance she wears <br />
So effortlessly mastered <br />
<br />
When a moment elapses <br />
That her beautyâ€™s unseen <br />
The next sight my eye catches <br />
Renders my intellect un-keen <br />
<br />
No matter how frequent, <br />
Or how many times <br />
I gaze at her, speechless, <br />
Tracing her lines <br />
<br />
Nothing could weaken <br />
Nor could it confine <br />
No! My love only deepens <br />
Spreading like vines <br />
 <br />
Through depths of despair, <br />
And my heart lain bare, <br />
My one true love, <br />
Is the one who was there. <br />
<br />
Her love is the lighthouse, <br />
Her heart burning pure, <br />
Leaving ashes of doubts, <br />
Til I am made sure.
